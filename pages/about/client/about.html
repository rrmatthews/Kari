      "Imagine not know what do with your hair
      but you flip through some categories and a specific list of items come up for you.
      And like bundles that you may like because you choose a category saying youre willing to wear weave
      and we can partner with black businesses..I really want it to become like a market for black business."<br>

      <p>"How can we design and create a web app that centers black women while highlighting
        the complexities of black hair? I was looking to create a place for black women to
        find new hairstyles and hair products. By working with Kariyana and a selection of other
        black women, I wanted to ensure that all design, functionality, and usage origninated from
        them." <br> <b>-R Matthews</b></p>
