    "Imagine not know what do with your hair
    but you flip through some categories and a specific list of items come up for you.<br>
    And like bundles that you may like because you choose a category saying youre willing to wear weave<br>
    and we can partner with black businesses..I really want it to become like a market for black business."<br>

    <p>How can we design and create a web app that centers black women while highlighting<br>
      the complexities of black hair? I was looking to create a place for black women to<br>
      find new hairstyles and hair products. Working with Kariyana and a selection of black<br>
      women, design and functionality came from them.<br> -R Matthews</p>
