# Kari (PersonalApp)
This Meteor web app was created as a part of the 2017 Voice, Web, Mobile App Design JBS Semester at Brandeis University under the instuction of Tim Hickey and Marie Meteer as a means of learning and exploring the web development.

## About the Web App
Kari is an app conceptualized by my friend Kariyana Calloway: 
<blockquote>"Imagine not know what do with your hair but you flip through some categories and a specific list of items come up for you. And like bundles that you may like because you choose a category saying youre willing to wear weave and we can partner with black businesses..I really want it to become like a market for black business." - Kariyana Calloway</blockquote>

I wanted to design and create a web app that centers black women while highlighting the complexities of black hair. And I was also looking to create a place for black women to find new hairstyles and hair products. By working with Kariyana and a selection of other black women, I wanted to ensure that all design, functionality, and usage origninated from them.

Currently, the app serves as a place for black women to upload the hair products they use into a database to be accessed by other users. It also has a section devoted to hair care tips and styles separated by black hair texture/type.

## Using the App
To use the app, use terminal / command prompt to work inside the main directory. Type "meteor run" into the command line and the web app will be loaded onto localhost:3000. To access the web app, go to "localhost:3000" in any web browser.
